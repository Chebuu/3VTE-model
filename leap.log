  total atoms in file: 85
  Leap added 66 missing atoms according to residue templates:
       34 Heavy
       32 H / lone pairs
  The file contained 66 atoms not in residue templates

/Users/sethmartinez/opt/anaconda3/envs/qcmm/bin/teLeap: Warning!
Since the number of added atoms equals the number of missing atoms, it is likely
that some atoms had incorrect names; you may want to use addPdbAtomMap to map
these names, or change the names in the PDB file.
